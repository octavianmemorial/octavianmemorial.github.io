        Since I learned about Octavian's passing, I cannot stop asking myself why it had to be him. He was not only an
        outstanding scientist whose contributions changed the field, but also a kind person who gave so much to others
        and
        made the world a better place. Judaism provides one perspective: “The death of the righteous effects atonement”,
        meaning that a demise of such a pure person gives us an opportunity to reset our lives, bringing light to our
        souls. When I grieve the loss of Octavian, my mind aggregates many daily encounters with him that I didn't give
        a
        second thought to at the time into a portrait of an amazing human being. Thinking of these times helps me how to
        reset in my own life moving forward. I want to share some of these impressions here.
        <br><br>
        <b>Octavian was brave.</b> By taking a brief look at his climbing pictures, it is easy to see that he was not
        afraid of
        physical challenge, and his mountaineering feats were astounding. What is harder to see is his bravery in
        research. Octavian had enough technical talent to produce many conventional machine learning papers that
        constitute the vast majority of the material published today in top conferences. It would have been a choice of
        least resistance. This was not Octavian's style: he focused his intellectual energy on hard problems which are
        beyond the reach of most and which are likely to change the field. It took him a while to identify the right
        question, but once he zoomed on it, he was unstoppable. I still remember our zoom conversations during the
        pandemic with children's noise in the background. Remembering the days when my son was a toddler, I couldn't
        imagine how Octavian managed to do any work in the house, let alone produce ground breaking research that
        required
        superior concentration. His relentless intellectual energy enabled him to move into new research directions,
        without being diverted by failed experiments and confusion along the way. This emotional robustness and creative
        power uniquely distinguished him from many technically talented researchers who are held by convention and fear.
        In his research and his mountaineering, he aimed for the highest peaks.
        <br><br>
        <b>Octavian was kind </b> and truly cared about others. In his short life, Octavian impacted so many people,
        both
        in his
        immediate environment and beyond. He was working with multiple young students around the world, helping them to
        find their own research footing. He not only cared about their research progress but also wanted to make sure
        that
        they are treated well. He never hesitated to ask Tommi and me to sponsor their trip. The younger students in the
        group saw him as somebody who can give a new perspective on the problem and help them refine their ideas,
        without
        judgment and with a lot of encouragement. In his three years at MIT, I've never heard him saying a demeaning
        comment. People were drawn to his positivity — by sharing his confidence with others to push forward despite the
        obstacles. In this terrible week after Octavian's demise, I heard a lot of stories from people at MIT on how he
        helped them to deal with challenging situations and impacted their lives. I also learned that he worked on a
        platform for students in rural areas of Romania to give them access to mathematical education similar in quality
        to the one he had. Octavian generously shared his kindness, ideas and resources never expecting any recognition
        or
        reward. He just wanted to make this world a better place for others.

        Octavian loved his family. I only once saw Octavian and Marina together. It was a party in my house in the
        pre-pandemic times. I still remember our conversation — our joint friend was sharing with us his romantic
        escapades when Octavian and Marina tried to make sense of it. While I don't remember the details, their kindness
        and care towards each other and that friend are still in my memory. I felt so happy for Octavian that he found
        himself a true match. Octavian's care for Marina and his family was reflected in many small and big deeds. When
        he
        got his first university offer, he knew that he couldn't take it, because it would not work well for Marina's
        job
        prospects. It was extremely important to him that Marina succeeds in her career and is happy with a new
        location.
        He multiple times mentioned to me how grateful he is that Marina agreed to come to the US when he wanted to do a
        postdoc at MIT. Balancing kids and career is a challenging proposition, especially during the postdoc time, with
        high research demands, limited funds and growing needs of the family. Octavian saw his family as the biggest
        blessing and the core of his support system. He was very time efficient, spending every free minute with the
        kids
        and Marina. He never removed his mask — he was always concerned about bringing COVID home and making others
        sick.
        In one of our conversations before he left, we talked about children's books and his habit of reading them to
        the
        kids.
        <br><br>
        I wish I would have known him better and spent more time with him. Both Octavian and I were constantly busy with
        our work and our families, especially at the time of the COVID isolation. Because he was so humble, he never
        bragged about any of his achievements and all the different ways he helped other people. I don't think I ever
        told
        him how much I admired him and loved being around him — most of our conversations focused on work. I am also
        sure
        that if I would have told him something like that he would have chuckled shyly and moved the conversation to
        other
        matters. He never sought to be in the spotlight. But he brought light to our souls, inspiring us to become
        better
        human beings. We miss you so much, our beloved Octavian!
